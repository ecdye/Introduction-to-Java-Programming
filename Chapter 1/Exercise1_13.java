 * Introduction to Java Programming, AP Edition. 10th ed.
 *
 * Problem: (Algebra: solve 2 x 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer's rule
 * to solve the following 2 x 2 system of linear equasion provided that ad - bc
 * is not 0:
 *
 * ax + by = e     ed - bf     af - ec
 *             x = ------- y = -------
 * cx + dy = f     ad - bc     ad - bc
 *
 * Write a program that solves the following equasion and displays the value for
 * x and y: (Hint: replace the symbols in the formula with numbers to compute x
 * and y. This exercise can be done in Chapter 1 without using materials in later
 * chapters.)
 *
 * 3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 * 2.1x + .55y = 5.9
